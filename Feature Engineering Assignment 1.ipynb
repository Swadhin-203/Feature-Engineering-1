    "# Q1: What are missing values in a dataset? Why is it essential to handle missing values? Name some algorithms that are not affected by missing values.\n",
    "Ans:In real world of data set, missing data, or missing values, occur when no data value is stored for the variable in an observation. Missing data are a common occurrence and can have a significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.The cause of missing values can be data corruption or failure to record data. The handling of missing data is very important during the preprocessing of the dataset as many machine learning algorithms do not support missing values.Histogram based Gradient-boosting Classifier / Regressor are some algorithims that are not affected by missing value."

    "Ans:A classification data set with skewed class porpotions is called imbalanced data set. Classes that covers the large proportions of the data set are called as the majority classes. The classes that covers the less proportions of the data set is called as the minority classes.Imbalanced dat set will lead algorithims to get good results by returning the majority.That will be a problem if we are interested in  the minority more.So, balancing is a way to force the algorithim to give more weight to the minority.If imbalanced datasets are not handled, the resulting model may be biased towards the majority class and unable to accurately predict the minority class. This can result in incorrect predictions and misclassification of minority class instances, which may have serious consequences in applications such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection.\n"

This can be done by randomly duplicating instances from the minority class, or by generating new synthetic instances.

In this case, the number of fraudulent transactions is typically much smaller than the number of legitimate transactions.

    "\n",
    "There are several ways to perform data augmentation, including image rotation, flipping, cropping, and changing the brightness and contrast of an image.

    "\n",
    "It is essential to handle outliers in a dataset because they can have a significant impact on statistical measures and machine learning models. Outliers can affect the mean and standard deviation, which are commonly used statistical measures to describe a dataset. If the dataset contains outliers, the mean may be skewed towards the outlier values, which can lead to incorrect interpretations of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, outliers can have a significant impact on the performance of models. Outliers can affect the fitting of the model, leading to overfitting or underfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and captures noise in the data, including outliers. Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple and is unable to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
